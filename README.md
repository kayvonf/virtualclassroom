Kayvon's ohyay-based virtual classroom is a 24-7 "always on" virtual classroom space that supports synchronous live lecture to up to 500 students, small student working groups (e.g., for breakouts or flipped classroom settings), and office hours. 


## 90-Second Getting Started

1. Create yourself a copy of the ohyay classroom, go the [project page](https://ohyay.co/space_gallery?itemId=ws_VQopSi1J) in the ohyay workspace gallery and press the "Explore" button.

2. The classroom is now running, and if you enter the site, you'll be on the main page that looks like this:

3. __Go to the class configuration panel.__ If you look in the top left corner, there's a little red button that will take you to the configuation pages.  The first thing you should go is click the red button that say "Make me staff".  This marks your account as a course staff account, which will give it extra priviledges in some rooms.  (You'll need to tell your TAs or co-instructors to do the same.)

4. __Enter basic information about your course.__ Now enter basic information about your class (class name, etc.) 

5. __Create yourself an office.__. Click the "Office Hours" tab in the configuration panel.  Give your office a name, choose a template for what you'd like your office to look like, and click the "Create New Office".  You now have an office.

6. __Explore your new classroom.__. That's it! Your classroom is now live.  Before going further I recommend exploring the various rooms of the space.  I describe some of the basic functionity in the video below.
