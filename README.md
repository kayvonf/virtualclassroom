Kayvon's ohyay-based virtual classroom is a 24-7 "always on" virtual classroom space that supports synchronous live lecture to up to 500 students, small student working groups (e.g., for breakouts or flipped classroom settings), and office hours. 

## Getting Started

1. Create yourself a copy of the ohyay classroom, go the [project page](https://ohyay.co/space_gallery?itemId=ws_VQopSi1J) in the ohyay workspace gallery and press the "Explore" button.

Enter basic information about your course (the course's name, provide a vanity url that you can provide your students and course staff, etc.).  

5. __Create yourself an office.__. Click the "Office Hours" tab in the configuration panel.  Give your office a name, choose a template for what you'd like your office to look like, and click the "Create New Office".  You now have an office!
